Feature: Functionality of the fig_newton gem

  Scenario: Getting basic configuration data from a yml config file
    Given I have read the configuration file
    When I ask for the value for "base_url"
    Then I should see "http://cheezyworld.com"

  Scenario: Requesting data that does not exist should result in error
    Given I have read the configuration file
    When I ask for a value that does not exist named "does_not_exist"
    Then I should raise a NoMethodError exception
    
  Scenario: Getting the default filename from an environment variable
    Given I have an environment variable named "FIG_NEWTON_FILE" set to "sample.yml"
    When I ask for the value for "from_the_env_file"
    Then I should see "read from the env file"
    
  Scenario: Using a file that has the same name as the hostname
    Given I have a yml file that is named after the hostname
    When I ask for the value for "from_the_hostname_file"
    Then I should see "read from the hostname file"
    And I should remove the file

  Scenario: Requesting data that contains a node of additional data
    Given I have read the configuration file
    When I ask for the value for "database"
    Then I should have a node
    And the "username" value for the node should be "steve"
    And the "password" value for the node should be "secret"

  Scenario: Requesting data from multiple nested data
    Given I have read the configuration file
    When I ask for the value for "first"
    And I ask for the node value for "second"
    Then the "third" value for the node should be "foo"
    And the "fourth" value for the node should be "bar"

  Scenario: Using default directory and file
    Given I have read the default file from the default directory
    When I ask for the value for "base_url"
    Then I should see "http://cheezyworld.com"
    
  Scenario:  Requesting a numerical value
    Given I have read the configuration file
    When I ask for the value for "port"
    Then I should see 1234

  Scenario:  Requesting data from a node can be converted to a hash
    Given I have read the configuration file
    When I ask for the value for "database"
    Then I should have a node
    And the hash of values should look like:
      | username | steve  |
      | password | secret |

  Scenario: Requesting data that does not exist but has a default value should return the default value
    Given I have read the configuration file
    When I ask for a value that does not exist named "does_not_exist" that has a default value "the default value"
    Then I should see "the default value"
  
  Scenario: Requesting data that does not exist but has a default block should return the block result
    Given I have read the configuration file
    When I ask for a value that does not exist named "does_not_exist" that has a default block returning "the default value"
    Then I should see "the default value"
  
  Scenario: Requesting data that does not exist but has a default lambda should return the lambda result
    Given I have read the configuration file
    When I ask for a value that does not exist named "does_not_exist" that has a default lambda returning "the default value"
    Then I should see "the default value"
    And the lambda should be passed the property "does_not_exist"
    
  Scenario: Requesting data that does not exist but has a default proc should return the proc result
    Given I have read the configuration file
    When I ask for a value that does not exist named "does_not_exist" that has a default proc returning "the default value"
    Then I should see "the default value"
